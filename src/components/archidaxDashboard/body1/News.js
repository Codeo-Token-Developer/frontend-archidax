          Global stocks steady as investors watch slow reopening of economy
        </h4>
        <p>
          Global stock markets were steady on Tuesday as investors monitored the
          gradual reopening of the world economy and signs of new infections in
          countries that have eased lockdown measures. The FTSE 100 rose 0.4 per
          cent, while Germany’s Dax and France’s CAC 40 traded around the
          flatline. The composite Stoxx 600 index rose 0.3 per cent.

          European Stocks Gain While U.S. Futures Edge Lower: Markets Wrap
        </h4>
        <p>
          (Bloomberg) -- European stocks edged higher, U.S. equity futures
          slipped and Asian shares dropped on Tuesday as investors weighed an
          up-tick in coronavirus infections in several nations and signs of
          fresh trade tension. Oil rose. The Stoxx 600 Index nudged upward after
          a downbeat start as gains for healthcare shares offset declines for
          the financial and energy sectors. S&P 500 futures retreated after the
          Trump administration moved on Monday night to block investments in
          Chinese equities by a government retirement fund. Stocks in Hong Kong
          and India led the retreat across Asia. Most European bonds slipped and
          Treasuries drifted higher. Global equities have recouped about half of
          their plunge after hitting a March low, but the sustainability of the
          rally remains in question amid poor economic data and company earnings
          and as countries begin to unwind lockdowns that froze economic
          activity. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. warned that investors got ahead of
          themselves and the S&P 500 Index could drop almost 20% in the next
          three months. “The increased risk from U.S./China trade relations and
          the data from countries at the leading edge of the virus spread are a
          real fly in the ointment for investors hungrily eying a rapid return
          to economic normality to justify their long risk exposure,” said James
          Athey, investment director at Aberdeen Standard. Wuhan, where the
          pandemic began, reported its first new infections since the Chinese
          city ended its lockdown last month. South Korea reported a flare-up in
          virus cases. Russia had a record number of new cases in one day.
          Germany recorded the first increase in new coronavirus infections in
          four days as it gradually relaxes restrictions. Here are some key
          events coming up: Regional Federal Reserve presidents James Bullard,
          Loretta Mester and Patrick Harker are due to speak at events on
          Tuesday.OPEC gives its monthly oil market report on Wednesday.U.S.
          weekly jobless claims data is due Thursday.China on Friday releases
          industrial production and retail sales data for April. These are the
          main moves in markets: Stocks Futures on the S&P 500 Index decreased
          0.2% as of 9:28 a.m. London time.The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose
          0.2%.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.7%. Currencies The Bloomberg
