          Global stock markets were steady on Tuesday as investors monitored the
          gradual reopening of the world economy and signs of new infections in
          countries that have eased lockdown measures. The FTSE 100 rose 0.4 per
          cent, while Germany’s Dax and France’s CAC 40 traded around the
          flatline. The composite Stoxx 600 index rose 0.3 per cent.

          European Stocks Gain While U.S. Futures Edge Lower: Markets Wrap

          (Bloomberg) -- European stocks edged higher, U.S. equity futures
          slipped and Asian shares dropped on Tuesday as investors weighed an
          up-tick in coronavirus infections in several nations and signs of
          fresh trade tension. Oil rose. The Stoxx 600 Index nudged upward after
          a downbeat start as gains for healthcare shares offset declines for
          the financial and energy sectors. S&P 500 futures retreated after the
          Trump administration moved on Monday night to block investments in
          Chinese equities by a government retirement fund. Stocks in Hong Kong
          and India led the retreat across Asia. Most European bonds slipped and
          Treasuries drifted higher. Global equities have recouped about half of
          their plunge after hitting a March low, but the sustainability of the
          rally remains in question amid poor economic data and company earnings
          and as countries begin to unwind lockdowns that froze economic
          activity.
